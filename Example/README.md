We also created several special effects for the LED Cube in the file led_cube.c.
This version is a standalone project that does not use the AI Vision module.
Simply run the code on the Raspberry Pi Pico, and it will light up the 8x8x8 LED Cube with predefined animations.

For developers who prefer more flexibility, we provide Cube_general.c, which offers a generalized implementation.
With this code, display effects can be easily modified by changing only the matrix definition.
